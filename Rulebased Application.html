            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the Dynamic Rule-Based Application! This documentation will guide you on using the application to create, modify, and manage rules that determine eligibility based on user attributes. The app allows administrators to build rule sets from scratch and create flexible, dynamic workflows.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="getting-started">
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>To start using the application, log in as an administrator and access the <strong>Dashboard</strong>. Here you will find options to create rules, manage existing rules, and view eligibility results.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Log in with your administrator credentials.</li>
                <li>Navigate to the <strong>Dashboard</strong> from the main menu.</li>
                <li>Click on <strong>Create New Rule</strong> to begin setting up a rule-based flow.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="creating-rules">
            <h2>Creating Rules</h2>
            <p>The application allows you to create rules by defining conditions based on user attributes such as age, income, and department. Follow these steps to set up a new rule:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Click on <strong>Create New Rule</strong> in the Dashboard.</li>
                <li>Select the attribute to base the rule on (e.g., Age, Income).</li>
                <li>Define conditions (e.g., Age > 18, Income < 50000).</li>
                <li>Click <strong>Save Rule</strong> to store the rule for future use.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each rule can have multiple conditions, allowing for complex decision trees.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="combining-rules">
            <h2>Combining Rules</h2>
            <p>To create dynamic workflows, you can combine multiple rules. This feature allows you to develop complex rule chains that evaluate various conditions simultaneously.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In the <strong>Rule Combination</strong> section, select rules you want to combine.</li>
                <li>Define the relationship (AND/OR) between rules.</li>
                <li>Preview the combined rule to ensure it matches your intended logic.</li>
                <li>Click <strong>Save Combination</strong> to apply.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section id="modifying-rules">
            <h2>Modifying Existing Rules</h2>
            <p>You can edit existing rules from the <strong>Rule Management</strong> section. This allows you to adjust conditions, rename rules, or remove rules as your requirements change.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Select the rule you wish to modify.</li>
                <li>Adjust the attributes or conditions as needed.</li>
                <li>Click <strong>Save Changes</strong> to update the rule.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Note: Changes to rules may affect existing workflows and eligibility checks.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="running-eligibility-checks">
            <h2>Running Eligibility Checks</h2>
            <p>With your rules in place, you can start performing eligibility checks for users. This feature evaluates a user's attributes against the rule set to determine eligibility.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Go to the <strong>Eligibility Check</strong> section.</li>
                <li>Select a user or input their attributes manually.</li>
                <li>Click <strong>Run Check</strong> to get a detailed eligibility report.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The report provides a summary of which rules were met or failed, offering a clear picture of the eligibility result.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="faq">
            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
            <h3>Can I delete a rule?</h3>
            <p>Yes, you can delete a rule by selecting it in the <strong>Rule Management</strong> section and clicking <strong>Delete</strong>. Be aware that deleting a rule may affect combined rules and eligibility checks.</p>

            <h3>How do I add more attributes for rule creation?</h3>
